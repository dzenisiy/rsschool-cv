### About me

I am a Key Developer and Team Lead specializing in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) with a strong focus on technical leadership, team coordination, and delivering high-quality solutions. I manage project scope, estimate features and functionality, and distribute tasks effectively while contributing to team growth through mentoring and interviews.

My AEM expertise includes developing templates, components, workflows, and OSGi services, as well as leveraging out-of-the-box components to deliver solutions efficiently. I am proactive in troubleshooting, performance tuning, log analysis, and documenting best practices to ensure maintainable and high-performing systems. Additionally, I collaborate with teams responsible for evolving application infrastructure architecture and oversee release and hotfix activities.

I am known for my flexible, self-motivated working style, strong ownership of problem resolution, and ability to solve complex challenges independently or within a collaborative team environment. I excel at prioritizing tasks under pressure and delivering results.

As a contributor to AEM ACS Commons, I extended the existing migration tool to support SFTP. My work can be explored [here](https://adobe-consulting-services.github.io/acs-aem-commons/features/mcp-tools/asset-ingestion/url-asset-ingestor/index.html)
